I got tired of watching players exploit Heavy Plate armor + vehicles.
This plugin blocks players from mounting into a vehicle with predefined armor.
The Json lets server owners set what armor is not allow in vehicles.

Heavy Plate is the default armor type in the .JSON

- **Permission:** *NoHeavyGear.bypass*

This permi bypasses any restrictons set in the .JSON file*
